## Local Business Homepage Restyle

I took the website of a local business that I frequent, Alpine Vet Care in Missoula, and gave their website homepage a refresh.
This project showcases my ability to use CSS with no libraries or frameworks to create a responsive webpage for desktop and mobile. 

### Original State
[alpinevetcare.com](alpinevetcare.com)

**Areas for Improvement**
* Inconsistent font size and color
* Does not use semantic HTML
* Outdated layout
* Mobile is a mix of center-aligned and right-aligned
* Banner image slideshow
* Contact info is not linked

### Skills Showcased
* HTML
* Pure CSS - FlexBox, Grid, Media Queries
* Web Design and User Experience
* Web Accessibility (NOTE: the checkbox hack, described below, is NOT fully web accessible)
* Responsive Design

### New Design
* Updated color palette based on logo colors
* Consistent font
* Semantic HTML for better web accessibility
* New sectioned layout
* Clickable links for phone, email, and address making it easier to users to interact with the website information they need
* Replaced generic article on homepage with services section, more relevant
* Reorganized the nav menu

### Fun Features and Key Takeaways
* Use of the "checkbox hack" for the mobile menu
I could have used JavaScript, but this was a fun feature to learn. I created the down/up arrows for the mobile submenu manually.
The checkbox hack utilizes the "checked" vs "not checked" property of a checkbox instead of "onClick" in JavaScript.

* Creating a 2-layer menu
It was intersting to learn different methods of creating a submenu for both dektop and mobile views. This is a very common feature in older or complex business websites.

### Future Enhancements
* Site Menu in Footer. The footer is already quite full. I might make it it's own section and add a site menu to the actual footer on the desktop version.
* It would be fun to do an entire website overhaul and build the other pages.
* Add JavaScript for more simplified functionality of the navbar.
* Add a "return to top" icon for mobile.


Overall, this was a great project to refresh my CSS skills. I think the new version is a large improvement on the current/old version.
